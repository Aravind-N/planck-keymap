# Custom Planck Layout
This planck layout changes some of the chorded layers and key mappings to be more similar to a standard keyboard. It must be compiled with the qmk firmware package (available at https://github.com/jackhumbert/qmk_firmware) and then loaded onto a planck keyboard with dfu or another bootloader
